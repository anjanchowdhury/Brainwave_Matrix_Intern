According to the Clinical Trials website, run by the National Institutes of Health, participants must be at least 14 years old and 18-24 weeks pregnant.The controversial study, led by Bliss Kaneshiro, MD and Kate Whitehouse, DO, will monitor bleeding during D&E abortions to determine the effects of the drug oxytocin, commonly used to minimize blood loss and decrease the risk of hemorrhage.The clinical trial, called  Effects of Oxytocin on Bleeding Outcomes during Dilation and Evacuation  began in October 2014 and is a collaboration between UH, Society of Family Planning and the University of Washington.The Society of Family Planning funds a number of similar research projects, such as experimenting with the dosage of Misoprostol, a uterine contracting agent, prior to surgical abortions at 13-18 weeks and exploring umbilical cord injections to produce fetal death prior to late-term abortions.In the UH study, researchers will carry out a  randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials,  to determine the effect of oxytocin s use on uterine bleeding, meaning that they will either provide or deny intravenous oxytocin to the women.Reports suggest that some doctors are concerned that withholding oxytocin during surgery may put patients, especially teen girls, at risk. This study is reminiscent of Nazi concentration camp experiments. I pity the poor women who are being treated like lab rats, especially those who are denied the drug to reduce hemorrhaging,  said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue.Dilation and evacuation abortions are surgical procedures that involve dismembering the pre-born baby with forceps, scraping the inside of the uterus with a curette to remove any residuals and finally suctioning out the womb to make sure the contents are completely removed.After the abortion, the corpse of the fetus is reassembled and examined to ensure everything was successfully removed and that the abortion was complete.The study is hoping to attract up to 166 test subjects and is expected to conclude in July 2015.Via: Breitbart News\",\n          \"CNN was quick to scoop up Corey Lewandowski after Donald Trump kicked him out of his role as campaign manager, but his first week on the job is going pretty much exactly how you would expect it to go   terribly.Not only has Lewandowski proven himself to be pretty much like a paid spokesman for Trump, but his defense of the disgraced GOP candidate isn t being received well. Earlier this week, Lewandowski revealed that he was under contract and couldn t criticize The Donald, even after being fired from the campaign. Today, Lewandowski got called out by Hillary Clinton surrogate Christine Quinn for hyping Trump up to be an expert on the Brexit decision   a suggestion that was clearly false.On Monday s edition of CNN s New Day, Lewandowski made another pathetic defense of Trump by trying to reframe the candidate s disgusting reaction to Brexit, where he mostly spoke about how much the decision would be good for his Scotland golf resort. Lewandowski s defense was: Obviously the U.S. dollar has become much stronger now against the British pound. If you re going to spend money in Europe, now would actually be a good time to go with the fall of the pound.What you have is a world view, so what you have is someone who is saying,  Let s look at this from the U.S. perspective. If you want to go and travel overseas   just from a monetary perspective   now is the right time to do that because what you re getting is more for your dollar. Quinn wasn t having it. She ripped into Lewandowski, firing back, Donald Trump is not running to be travel agent of the world, he s running to be president of the United States.  She continued: What he said wasn t a commentary on international markets, it was,  When the pound goes down, more people will come to my golf course. Donald Trump s main concern isn t the international markets, it isn t the impact that Brexit will have on hard working Americans  401Ks, it s himself. How can he make more money, how can he put more money in his bank account? Lewandowski compared the Brexit decision to Trump s rise in the GOP, and Quinn once again called him out and put him back in his place. She said: Trump touted that he saw this coming. That s ridiculous because when he was first asked about Brexit by the press, he didn t appear to know what it was. Lewandowski tried to counter by insisting that People are too smart, they are tired of being told what to do.  He then tried to commend Trump for being a selfish moron: You know what Donald Trump said about Brexit? What he said was, you don t have to listen to me because it s not my decision. He didn t weigh in like Hillary Clinton did, like Barack Obama did, saying that you can t do this. Quinn fought back, Because he didn t know what it was. Lewandowski was fighting a losing battle. Trump s reaction to Brexit was just as terrifying as it was humorous   it truly proved that Trump knows nothing about foreign affairs, and hasn t spent any time educating himself since the beginning of his presidential candidacy. If only some of the hours he spent getting into fights on Twitter were being used for learning about how the world works. But instead, he once again exposed himself as an unfit choice for President. And when people like Lewandowski try to make sense of his idiocy, they only make themselves look equally foolish.You can watch the embarrassing video below:Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"A Michigan woman decided to defend against tyranny? when she and another shopper couldn t agree over who got to buy the last notebook on the shelf at the Novi Towne Center store.According to ABC 13, the brawl   yes, brawl    involved two Farmington Hills residents, ages 46 and 32, and a mother and daughter from South Lyon, ages 51 and 20. In other words, these were all grown adults who should have known better but hey   there was only one notebook on the shelf, and we ve all seen what happens in those post-apocalyptic movies when a store is down to the last gallon of milk, right?Two of the women, one of whom was the unnamed 20-year-old, reached for the notebook at the same time. The 46 and 32-year-olds apparently decided that she wasn t getting their goddamn notebook and began pulling her hair.Then, because this had almost hit peak  trailer park,  the 20-year-old s mother decided to go for bonus points by pulling out her gun. Fortunately, someone pushed her aside before she could do any harm.This is one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  (conservatives can t dismiss this one, as it is confirmed that she is a concealed carry permit holder)   ready to leap into action at the most minor sign of danger and make things worse by turning the situation potentially deadly.Watch it happen below:Featured image via screengrab\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1681,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jun 5, 2015\",\n          \"August 28, 2016\",\n          \"June 3, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

According to the Clinical Trials website, run by the National Institutes of Health, participants must be at least 14 years old and 18-24 weeks pregnant.The controversial study, led by Bliss Kaneshiro, MD and Kate Whitehouse, DO, will monitor bleeding during D&E abortions to determine the effects of the drug oxytocin, commonly used to minimize blood loss and decrease the risk of hemorrhage.The clinical trial, called  Effects of Oxytocin on Bleeding Outcomes during Dilation and Evacuation  began in October 2014 and is a collaboration between UH, Society of Family Planning and the University of Washington.The Society of Family Planning funds a number of similar research projects, such as experimenting with the dosage of Misoprostol, a uterine contracting agent, prior to surgical abortions at 13-18 weeks and exploring umbilical cord injections to produce fetal death prior to late-term abortions.In the UH study, researchers will carry out a  randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials,  to determine the effect of oxytocin s use on uterine bleeding, meaning that they will either provide or deny intravenous oxytocin to the women.Reports suggest that some doctors are concerned that withholding oxytocin during surgery may put patients, especially teen girls, at risk. This study is reminiscent of Nazi concentration camp experiments. I pity the poor women who are being treated like lab rats, especially those who are denied the drug to reduce hemorrhaging,  said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue.Dilation and evacuation abortions are surgical procedures that involve dismembering the pre-born baby with forceps, scraping the inside of the uterus with a curette to remove any residuals and finally suctioning out the womb to make sure the contents are completely removed.After the abortion, the corpse of the fetus is reassembled and examined to ensure everything was successfully removed and that the abortion was complete.The study is hoping to attract up to 166 test subjects and is expected to conclude in July 2015.Via: Breitbart News\",\n          \"CNN was quick to scoop up Corey Lewandowski after Donald Trump kicked him out of his role as campaign manager, but his first week on the job is going pretty much exactly how you would expect it to go   terribly.Not only has Lewandowski proven himself to be pretty much like a paid spokesman for Trump, but his defense of the disgraced GOP candidate isn t being received well. Earlier this week, Lewandowski revealed that he was under contract and couldn t criticize The Donald, even after being fired from the campaign. Today, Lewandowski got called out by Hillary Clinton surrogate Christine Quinn for hyping Trump up to be an expert on the Brexit decision   a suggestion that was clearly false.On Monday s edition of CNN s New Day, Lewandowski made another pathetic defense of Trump by trying to reframe the candidate s disgusting reaction to Brexit, where he mostly spoke about how much the decision would be good for his Scotland golf resort. Lewandowski s defense was: Obviously the U.S. dollar has become much stronger now against the British pound. If you re going to spend money in Europe, now would actually be a good time to go with the fall of the pound.What you have is a world view, so what you have is someone who is saying,  Let s look at this from the U.S. perspective. If you want to go and travel overseas   just from a monetary perspective   now is the right time to do that because what you re getting is more for your dollar. Quinn wasn t having it. She ripped into Lewandowski, firing back, Donald Trump is not running to be travel agent of the world, he s running to be president of the United States.  She continued: What he said wasn t a commentary on international markets, it was,  When the pound goes down, more people will come to my golf course. Donald Trump s main concern isn t the international markets, it isn t the impact that Brexit will have on hard working Americans  401Ks, it s himself. How can he make more money, how can he put more money in his bank account? Lewandowski compared the Brexit decision to Trump s rise in the GOP, and Quinn once again called him out and put him back in his place. She said: Trump touted that he saw this coming. That s ridiculous because when he was first asked about Brexit by the press, he didn t appear to know what it was. Lewandowski tried to counter by insisting that People are too smart, they are tired of being told what to do.  He then tried to commend Trump for being a selfish moron: You know what Donald Trump said about Brexit? What he said was, you don t have to listen to me because it s not my decision. He didn t weigh in like Hillary Clinton did, like Barack Obama did, saying that you can t do this. Quinn fought back, Because he didn t know what it was. Lewandowski was fighting a losing battle. Trump s reaction to Brexit was just as terrifying as it was humorous   it truly proved that Trump knows nothing about foreign affairs, and hasn t spent any time educating himself since the beginning of his presidential candidacy. If only some of the hours he spent getting into fights on Twitter were being used for learning about how the world works. But instead, he once again exposed himself as an unfit choice for President. And when people like Lewandowski try to make sense of his idiocy, they only make themselves look equally foolish.You can watch the embarrassing video below:Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"A Michigan woman decided to defend against tyranny? when she and another shopper couldn t agree over who got to buy the last notebook on the shelf at the Novi Towne Center store.According to ABC 13, the brawl   yes, brawl    involved two Farmington Hills residents, ages 46 and 32, and a mother and daughter from South Lyon, ages 51 and 20. In other words, these were all grown adults who should have known better but hey   there was only one notebook on the shelf, and we ve all seen what happens in those post-apocalyptic movies when a store is down to the last gallon of milk, right?Two of the women, one of whom was the unnamed 20-year-old, reached for the notebook at the same time. The 46 and 32-year-olds apparently decided that she wasn t getting their goddamn notebook and began pulling her hair.Then, because this had almost hit peak  trailer park,  the 20-year-old s mother decided to go for bonus points by pulling out her gun. Fortunately, someone pushed her aside before she could do any harm.This is one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  (conservatives can t dismiss this one, as it is confirmed that she is a concealed carry permit holder)   ready to leap into action at the most minor sign of danger and make things worse by turning the situation potentially deadly.Watch it happen below:Featured image via screengrab\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1681,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jun 5, 2015\",\n          \"August 28, 2016\",\n          \"June 3, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

He also said he would cut off funding to cities that give immigrants sanctuary.But his main point, as usual, was all about his damn wall along the Mexican border.Trump has repeatedly declared that Mexico will pay for this massive structure, which experts estimate will cost up to $25 billion.But during his speech, Trump changed his tune in a way that suggests America will actually be picking up the tab and merely hoping that Mexico will reimburse us for the cost. The End Illegal Immigration act fully funds the construction of a wall on our southern border,  Trump said.  Don t worry about it. Remember I said that Mexico is paying for the wall. However, he then added this remark. With the full understanding that the country of Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such a wall, okay? Here s the video via YouTube. Trump s remarks on the wall are at the 32:46 mark.In other words, America will be paying for Trump s wall if he becomes president, NOT Mexico.Because in order for there to even be a need for Mexico to reimburse us, it means America would have to pay for the wall first. And that means American taxpayers would be on the hook.But just like his insistence that Mexico will pay for the wall outright, Trump has no way of forcing Mexico to reimburse us either. So Trump just promised to INCREASE the national debt by billions of dollars within his first 100 days.In short, the central promise Trump made to his supporters has just gone up entirely in smoke.The question is are Trump s supporters too dumb to notice that their hero just admitted that he has been lying to them this whole time? Probably not.Featured Image: Screenshot\",\n          \"We ve seen the overpriced t-shirts before from other candidates but The Hillary Clinton store takes it to a new level .  everyday items made by everyday people ?

Those who followed her instructions were met with the message:  Just go ahead and donate!  with suggested amounts of $5 to the upper limit $2,700.

Parliament still has to ratify the vote, so it s not a binding resolution (yet), however, it has already had some terrible effects on the U.K. Since the vote, the rate of blatant racism and hate crimes has skyrocketed over there. Brexit turned the U.K. into what we ve become here, thanks to the rise of Donald Trump.What s sad is that, according to The Independent, many of the perpetrators of these crimes cite the  leave  vote as a reason for their crimes, because that totally makes it okay. Yet, the victims of those crimes aren t just immigrants   many of them are people who were born in the U.K., but don t look sufficiently  domestic  for the xenophobic white supremacists that have taken over the country.Sound familiar? It s because we have that problem here, thanks to Trump and his xenophobic, white supremacist followers. Just look at what CBS reporter Sopan Deb goes through while covering His Royal Racist. He s repeatedly asked if he works for ISIS, and is frequently the target of Islamophobic remarks from Trump s loyal fans. He was also assaulted by cops at Trump s cancelled rally in Chicago.Social media is abuzz with this. There s a photo album on Facebook, called Worrying Signs, that contains well over 100 instances of people talking about racist encounters, or witnessing that racism happen to someone else. Below is a sampling of tweets that show what s happening across the pond:Man s t-shirt reads  Welcome to Britain now fit in or f*ck off . Tells me he s got his  country back.

Kirsty Allan (@kirstyrallan) June 26, 2016Here in the U.S., we have a Trump fan running for Congress who wants to  make America white again.  We have people who are just fine with Trump saying that Latinos are  illegals  who are  rapists and killers.  We have a state governor who claimed the rise of drug abuse in his state was due to guys with names like  D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty,  and said that they  impregnate a young white girl before they leave.  He replied to criticism with,  Race is irrelevant. Trump didn t create these problems, his rise just made it okay to be a racist pig in the open, and claim that anyone who s offended is just trying to force  political correctness  on them. And so it is with the U.K., where the Brexit movement made it okay to be openly racist towards immigrants again.We hope these people the ones who spurred this xenophobic outrage by painting anyone who isn t a white, British native as one of their main problems are proud of themselves.Featured image by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

He also said he would cut off funding to cities that give immigrants sanctuary.But his main point, as usual, was all about his damn wall along the Mexican border.Trump has repeatedly declared that Mexico will pay for this massive structure, which experts estimate will cost up to $25 billion.But during his speech, Trump changed his tune in a way that suggests America will actually be picking up the tab and merely hoping that Mexico will reimburse us for the cost. The End Illegal Immigration act fully funds the construction of a wall on our southern border,  Trump said.  Don t worry about it. Remember I said that Mexico is paying for the wall. However, he then added this remark. With the full understanding that the country of Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such a wall, okay? Here s the video via YouTube. Trump s remarks on the wall are at the 32:46 mark.In other words, America will be paying for Trump s wall if he becomes president, NOT Mexico.Because in order for there to even be a need for Mexico to reimburse us, it means America would have to pay for the wall first. And that means American taxpayers would be on the hook.But just like his insistence that Mexico will pay for the wall outright, Trump has no way of forcing Mexico to reimburse us either. So Trump just promised to INCREASE the national debt by billions of dollars within his first 100 days.In short, the central promise Trump made to his supporters has just gone up entirely in smoke.The question is are Trump s supporters too dumb to notice that their hero just admitted that he has been lying to them this whole time? Probably not.Featured Image: Screenshot\",\n          \"We ve seen the overpriced t-shirts before from other candidates but The Hillary Clinton store takes it to a new level .  everyday items made by everyday people ?

Parliament still has to ratify the vote, so it s not a binding resolution (yet), however, it has already had some terrible effects on the U.K. Since the vote, the rate of blatant racism and hate crimes has skyrocketed over there. Brexit turned the U.K. into what we ve become here, thanks to the rise of Donald Trump.What s sad is that, according to The Independent, many of the perpetrators of these crimes cite the  leave  vote as a reason for their crimes, because that totally makes it okay. Yet, the victims of those crimes aren t just immigrants   many of them are people who were born in the U.K., but don t look sufficiently  domestic  for the xenophobic white supremacists that have taken over the country.Sound familiar? It s because we have that problem here, thanks to Trump and his xenophobic, white supremacist followers. Just look at what CBS reporter Sopan Deb goes through while covering His Royal Racist. He s repeatedly asked if he works for ISIS, and is frequently the target of Islamophobic remarks from Trump s loyal fans. He was also assaulted by cops at Trump s cancelled rally in Chicago.Social media is abuzz with this. There s a photo album on Facebook, called Worrying Signs, that contains well over 100 instances of people talking about racist encounters, or witnessing that racism happen to someone else. Below is a sampling of tweets that show what s happening across the pond:Man s t-shirt reads  Welcome to Britain now fit in or f*ck off . Tells me he s got his  country back.

Kirsty Allan (@kirstyrallan) June 26, 2016Here in the U.S., we have a Trump fan running for Congress who wants to  make America white again.  We have people who are just fine with Trump saying that Latinos are  illegals  who are  rapists and killers.  We have a state governor who claimed the rise of drug abuse in his state was due to guys with names like  D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty,  and said that they  impregnate a young white girl before they leave.  He replied to criticism with,  Race is irrelevant. Trump didn t create these problems, his rise just made it okay to be a racist pig in the open, and claim that anyone who s offended is just trying to force  political correctness  on them.
